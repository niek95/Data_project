          Police budgets are never big enough to handle all cases being reported.
          To make sure the available budget is being spent as efficiently as
          possible it is useful to know when and where certain types of crimes are
          committed. This way, police departments can allocate resources where
          they are needed. As the amount of crimes is very high for a city as big
          as New York, I built an interactive visualization to help police
          departments in determining where and when capacity is needed the most.
          Data is sourced from the following kaggle dataset, which is based on
          official New York police data:
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/adamschroeder/crimes-new-york-city">

      </div>
      <div class="usagetext">
        <h5>Usage</h5>
        <br>
        <p>
          The map of New york can be manipulated with the sliders seen below. Either
          a specific time of day, or a specific day of the week can be selected.
          Additionally, a crime type can be selected in the dropdown menu.
          Data will be shown for either violations, misdemeanors or felonies.
          When a precinct in the map is clicked, data specific to that precinct
          will be shown in the line graph and calendar. The 'all'
          button reverts the selected precinct back to all precincts combined.

        <h5>Notable patterns in data</h5>
        <p>
          When going through the data there are a few things that stand out.
          Firstly, in the map, there is one precinct that stands out. Precint
          75 has historically been notorious for its high crime numbers. In the
          late 1980's and early 1990's, someone was killed in this precinct
          <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/12/13/the-reign-of-terror-when-murder-was-king-of-new-york-in-the-80s-and-90s/">every 63 hours</a>.
          In the following years this rate has gone down. But as the data shows
          it is still the most dangerous precinct in New York City.
          <br>
          <br>
          Also interesting is the amount of misdemeanors in precinct 14, which
          is almost double that of surrounding precincts, mostly in the
          afternoon and early evening. Precinct 14 oversees, amongst other
          things, Times Square, notorious for its pickpockets and high numbers
          of tourists.
          <br>
          <br>
          We also see a significant rise in crime on january first, while crime
          seems to typically go down in the weeks before. This could
          be due to new years, and the massive amount of people that are drawn
          to the city for this event. But there might be other explanations that
          could be worth investigating by the NYPD.
          <br>
          <br>
          Finally we see in the line graph that for most precincts and crime
          types, most crime occurs roughly between the late afternoon and early
          evening. This information could be used by police to send out more
          patrol cars around these times, for instance.
