### About
This project contains a visualization of different categories of crimes
committed in New York City in 2014. Users can view data by the day of the week
or by time of day, as well as totals for the entire year. Data is categorised
by police precinct and can be viewed on a heatmap of the city. The published
github page can be found [here](https://niek95.github.io/Data_project/).

### Features
* Select crimes by type: violations, misdemeanors, felonies or all
* A heatmap of the sum of all crime in 2014, a combined total of all crime on a certain day of the week or the combined total of all crime in a certain hour of the day, by precinct.
* A line-chart of the sum of the crimes committed in a certain hour of the day
* A calendar heatmap showing the amount of crimes committed in New York on each day of the year
* When a police precinct is clicked, the line chart and calendar updates with data from that precinct.

### Screenshots
